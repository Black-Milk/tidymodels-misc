## Miscellaneous tidymodels functions

This repository is a place for me to develop and test functions that build upon the tidymodels ecosystem. I develop new functions as they are needed in my day-to-day work.

__Current Functions__:

* tune_cv_reg() : automated k-fold cross-validation hyperparameter tuning for regression-based parsnip models
* predict_binary() : standardize output of predictions on classification-based parsnip models (truth, class probabilities, and outcome class)


__In Development__:

* tune_cv_class() : automated k-fold cross-validation hyperparameter tuning for classification-based parsnip models


__Future Ideas__:

* combine tune_cv_reg() and tune_cv_class() into a single tune_cv() function
* create parallelized variants of tune_cv_reg() and tune_cv_class() using furrr package
